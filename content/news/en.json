The City Council of Lleida wanted to offer quality music to all audiences and it chose Band music to do so.</p> <p>The Fem Banda “Germans Roig i Torné” festival first took place in autumn 2004. Since then, we have been able to savour quality live music in our city, offered by some of the best bands in the country.</p> <p>The festival had a great reception and Banda Municipal de Lleida (BML) has been involved in the organisation of the Fem Banda in each of its editions. This has made it possible for us to establish close links with other bands and musical societies.</p>",
            "text" : "<p>2015 will be a very important year for us. It marks our 100th year of existence, and we have decided that it is the time for the festival to move a step forward. The festival has, thus, become open to international bands. That is why it is our pleasure to announce that:</p> <p>Banda Municipal de Lleida (BML), member of the World Association of Symphonic Bands (WASBE), would like to welcome you to the FEM BANDA 2015: International Band Music Festival of Lleida, which will take place from Thursday, 2nd July to Sunday, 5th July 2015 in our beautiful city.</p> <p>Fem Banda 2015 will also feature two contests, apart from the festival: a Symphonic Band contest in Auditori Enric Granados (Lleida’s Concert Hall) and a Marching Band contest, taking place in Camps Elisis (a beautiful park in the heart of our city).</p> <p>The festival will also welcome music schools and all sort of music groups, bands and cultural societies. They will also have their spot within the festival.</p> <p>The city of Lleida is ideally located between the cosmopolitan capital of Catalonia, Barcelona, and the Pyrenees, with its UNESCO World Heritage Romanic architecture. Its location makes Lleida the perfect tourist destination within the Iberian Peninsula.</p> <p>Making Fem Banda a reference for band music in Catalonia is an exciting challenge. This is our motivation for organising this international event with outmost efficiency and professionalism.</p>"
